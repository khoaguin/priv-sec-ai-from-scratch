# Fully Connected Neural Network
This implementation is my solutions to the first homework of the course Deep Learning at NYU, 2021. Link: https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP21/.  
For deep learning, it is not just coding that is important, but even more so the understanding of the underlying theory. `theory.pdf` contains my answers for the theory part in `homework1.pdf`. I try to make things as clear as possible, however, there are parts that I still have doubts. It is great if you can walk through them and find out my mistakes. Please make an issues to notify me about them, I am more than happy to discuss and fix them.  
The practical part is in `mlp.py`.
