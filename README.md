# Private &amp; Secure AI from Scratch
Hi, here are my implementations of Private &amp; Secure AI concepts from scratch. The goal is to exercise these fundamental concepts using only Numpy and Python's standard libraries. I am also learning Rust, so there will also be implementations in Rust in the future.

## Concepts
- [x] Two-layer Fully-Connected Neural Network
- [ ] Fully-Connected Neural Network (Modular Fashion) - DOING
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Network
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Network
- [ ] Split Learning
- [ ] Federated Learning
- [ ] Differential Privacy
- [ ] Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent
- [ ] Paillier Additive Homomorphic Cryptosystem and Encrypted Linear Model Evaluation using Paillier (in Python & Rust)
- [ ] Blockchain
